# Mini Project - Take a Break


# Loop
* [While Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)
 * With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.
 * With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.
* [For Loopes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)

#[Time Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#module-time)
* [time.sleep](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep), suspend execution of the calling thread for the given number of seconds. 
* [time.ctime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.ctime),  convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string representing local time.

Ctrl+C to stop shell.

# Practice: Planning the Break
* Making the Program Wait Longer by changing the second in the parenthesis of  `time.sleep()`, like `time.sleep(2 * 60 * 60)`
