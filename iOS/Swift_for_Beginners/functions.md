# Parameters vs. Arguments
There are some special terms here that require special attention. When we look at the definition of a function like `sayHelloToStudent(student: String)`, any input values that are specified are called parameters. Then, when we actually call a function, as in `sayHelloToStudent(student: jarrod)` the input values that are passed to the function are known as arguments.
