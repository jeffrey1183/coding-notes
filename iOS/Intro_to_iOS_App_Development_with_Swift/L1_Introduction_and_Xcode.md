You can use Xcode to create apps for any of Apple's platforms from the Watch to Apple TV to iOS, and even the Mac.

# Pitch Perfect Overview
We're going to create in this course called Pitch Perfect. Pitch Perfect allows you to record your voice and play it back with various sound effects, including changes to speed, pitch and even reverb an echo.

As you build this app you'll learn key iOS development concepts along the way.

# Creating a Hello World Swift iOS App
opening Xcode. Then go to File > New > Project. This will open up a new project wizard. Make sure that you have selected the iOS section. And then select a Single View Application and click Next.

[Xcode Keyboard Shortcuts](https://swifteducation.github.io/assets/pdfs/XcodeKeyboardShortcuts.pdf)


#Xcode Shortcuts
Xcode has numerous keyboard shortcuts that are worth learning. Knowing them can help speed up your iOS development, and it saves you from having to reach over to the mouse or trackpad.

On the Navigator Panel on the left side, the following keyboard shortcuts cycle through the different navigators.

⌘ + 0 = Show or Hide the Navigator Panel
⌘ + 1 = Project
⌘ + 2 = Source Control
⌘ + 3 = Symbol
⌘ + 4 = Find
⌘ + 5 = Issue
⌘ + 6 = Test
⌘ + 7 = Debug
⌘ + 8 = Breakpoint
⌘ + 9 = Report

The Utility Area on the right side of Xcode can also be toggled with the following keyboard shortcuts:

⌥ + ⌘ + 0 = Show or Hide the Utility Area
⌥ + ⌘ + 1 = File Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 2 = Quick Help Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 3 = Identity Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 4 = Attributes Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 5 = Size Inspector
⌥ + ⌘ + 6 = Connections Inspector

If you right click (control click) on the Storyboard in the editor, then you can select a zoom level. You can also use 2 finger pinch in your Mac's trackpad to zoom in and out of the Storyboard.

# MVC
Remember that each view controller always has at least one view. MVC also allows re-use of the code, as there is only one model class used by the two view controllers.


MVC

* view, controller, model
* view and model will tell the controller what they need
* MVC is used for iOS and Mac apps



開一個新專案

* 在 Xcode 開一個專案，選擇 Single view application\(open up a new project wizard, And then select a Single View Application\)
* Xcode 裡右上角的黃色箭頭可以做修復的動作
* simulator 會預設出現 TV out，[可以把它關掉](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29721782/xcode-disable-tv-out-window)
* 可以從 window&gt;scale 去調整畫面大小
