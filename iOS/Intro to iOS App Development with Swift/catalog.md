Build An App called Pitch Perfect that lets you record your voice and play it back with sound and effects.

需要一些基礎 IF statements loops and classes in Swift. We'll build on that foundation to show you how to write your first app.

# What I have Learned
* Xcode\(從 Watch, Apple TV to iOS 到 Mac\)
* Audio Layouts and Buttons\(會刻一個畫面讓用戶錄音, set up the initial screen of the app for the user to record their own voice\)
  * how to lay out the user interface \(刻UI\)
  * how to connect UI elements such as our buttons to code
  * audio effects 會放一個入口讓用戶 can apply audio effects
* Delegation and Recording
  * how to pass the recorded audio from the first screen to the second
* Playback and Audio Effects
  * add the functionality for adding various alterations to the pitch


* [Fix the problem of
