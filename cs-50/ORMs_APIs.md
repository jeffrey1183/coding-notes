# Object-Oriented Programming
Before we dive back into databases, we're first going to talk about object-oriented programming. You can think of an object as just a thing. 

For example, an object might be a flight. We'll have a Passenger class that is going to represent the generic idea of a passenger, where that passenger is going to have a name and they'll also be associated with the flight that they're currently registered for. 

And so using object-oriented programming in Python, we'll be able to programmatically devise these ideas inside of code.

## I've Learned:
* Defining a Python class of flight. [Constructing classes and define objects in Python.](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-construct-classes-and-define-objects-in-python-3)
* Creating the init method, which is going to describe what happens when we first want to create a flight. And this init method will take a couple of parameters.

* [My source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/ORMs_APIs/classes1.py)

## I've Learned:
* Create a flight object.
* Change the value of a variable.
* Print details about flight object.

* [My source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/ORMs_APIs/classes2.py)

## I've Learned:
* Print out the infomation of flights.
* Self is always going to be the first thing that passed into a method for an individual object.

# Example 4: classes3.py

* [My source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/ORMs_APIs/classes3.py)

## I've Learned:
* Creating a delay method when the flight's running late.

# Example 4: classes4.py

* [My source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/ORMs_APIs/classes4.py)

## I've Learned:
* Update the counter every time we create a new flight.




APIs, Application Programming Interfaces that we can allow other applications to interact with our application and ways that we can use APIs written by other people to get access to other data as well.
