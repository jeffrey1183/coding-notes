# CS 50 Notes
The course of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript from Harvard is a great beginning to know the field of computer science. It's eligible for someone who don't have any experience in coding. And no need to purchase any software whatsoever.

As a product manager of software, the knowledge is helpful for my job. Here is the catalog and projects of this course.

This class includes a lot of overviews of HTML, CSS and Python programming language. Let's get a whirlwind tour of those programming languages.

The advantage of this series is understanding each programming language quickly. And then according to your interest and master it.

At first I installed Atom as my IDE, now I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac). 

As a product manager, I always define the specification of websites and apps. In my notes,I list each example including what features.

There are many ways to demo and deploy your learning to internet. My way is using [Github Pages](https://youtu.be/1u2qu-EmIRc?t=6006). It lets your GitHub repository deploy it to the internet and able to look at for everyone.
