# CS 50 Notes
The course of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript from Harvard is a great beginning to know the field of computer science. It's eligible for someone who don't have any experience in coding. And no need to purchase any software whatsoever.

As a product manager of software, the knowledge is helpful for my job. Here is the catalog and projects of this course.

This course includes a lot of overviews of HTML, CSS and Python programming language. Let's get a whirlwind tour of those programming languages.

The advantage of this series is understanding each programming language quickly. And then according to your interest and master it.

As a product manager, I always define the specification of websites and apps. In my notes,I list each example including what features.


Catalog

Projects

"Advanced Learning" in my notes is what I learn more than original course. I actively find relative and extensive knowledge.

# My Tools

## Visual Studio Code
At first I installed Atom as my IDE, now I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac). 

[Quickly launch files in a browser from VS code.](https://www.webucator.com/blog/2016/06/launch-files-browser-visual-studio-code/)

## GitHub Pages
There are many ways to demo and deploy your learning to internet. My way is using [Github Pages](https://youtu.be/1u2qu-EmIRc?t=6006). It lets your GitHub repository deploy it to the internet and able to look at for everyone.
