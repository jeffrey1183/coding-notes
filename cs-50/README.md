# CS 50 Notes
The course of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript from Harvard is a great beginning to know the field of computer science. It's eligible for someone who don't have any experience in coding. And no need to purchase any software whatsoever.

As a product manager of software, the knowledge is helpful for my job. Here is the catalog and projects of this course.

This class includes a lot of overviews of HTML, CSS and Python programming language. Let's get a whirlwind tour of those programming languages.

The advantage of this series is understanding each programming language quickly. And then according to your interest and master it.

At first I installed Atom as my IDE, now I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac). 

As a product manager, I always define the specification of websites and apps. In my notes,I list each example including what features.

Catalog
* Git
* HTML and CSS
* Flask
* SQL
* ORMs, APIs
* JavaScript
* Front Ends
* Django
* Test, CI/CD
* Github, Travis CI
* Scalability
* Security

Projects
* Project 0
* Project 1
* Project 2
* Project 3
* Final project

"Advanced Learning" in my notes is what I learn more than original course. I actively find relative and extensive knowledge.
