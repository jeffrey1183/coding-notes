# CS 50 Notes
The course of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript from Harvard is a great beginning to know the field of computer science. It's eligible for someone who don't have any experience in coding. And no need to purchase any software whatsoever.

As a product manager of software, the knowledge is helpful for my job. Here is the catalog and projects of this course.

"Advanced Learning" in my notes is what I learning exceed the original knowledge. I actively find relative and extensive knowledge.
