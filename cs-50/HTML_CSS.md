* Select which color you might want by using [colors hex value](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp).
* Three different ways to style your web page. The style0.html is the style attribute directly in the HTML. The style1.html is factoring it out into the header of the HTML page. The style2.html is taking the CSS separate out into a different file. Even if there are many HTML files, they can all reference the same CSS file. It's the most common way you'll use.

* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/child.html)

## I've Learned:
* Select list items that are immediate children, directly descended from any ordered list. The unordered list inside of the ordered list, those aren't styled. Because they're grandchildren of the ordered list.


# Example 20: [attribute.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/attribute.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=2871)

* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/hover.html)

## I've Learned:
* Pseudo-class is a specific state of an HTML element which is for interacting with that web page. Take this for example, When we hover over a button, it changes into another color.


# Example 22: [before.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/before.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=3188)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/before.html)

## I've Learned:
* A [CSS pseudo-element](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp) is used to style specified parts of an element. And in this case, the content is slash 21d2, And what this is saying is I want to apply some styling that happens before the contents of the actual link.

# Example 23: [selection.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/selection.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=3309)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/selection.html)

# Example 24: [print.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/print.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=3586)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/print.html)

## I've Learned:
* Using [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) to specify a particular paragraph not displaying when I print the page. 

# Example 25: [responsive0.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/responsive0.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=3741)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/responsive0.html)

## I've Learned:
* Using [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) to control the content being viewed on different-sized devices. In this case, when the width is at least 500 pixels, the backgroud color is red. When the width is below 500 pixels, the backgroud color is blue.
 * Examples from [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8549529/what-is-the-difference-between-screen-and-only-screen-in-media-queries#_=_)

# Example 26: [responsive1.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/responsive1.html)

* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/responsive1.html)

## I've Learned:
* Using [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) to display different content on different pixels. 
* [Setting the viewport](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp)

* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/flexbox.html)

## I've Learned:
* [CSS flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) is the solution when we have items appearing in multiple columns of content across the screen, we might want those things to move around as we begin to resize the window in order to make it more adaptable to different platforms and different devices. 

# Example 28: [grid.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/grid.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=4270)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/grid.html)

## I've Learned:
* Displays information in a [grid format](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) which is sort of like a table.
* Set the width of your grid columns by [grid-template-columns](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_grid-template.asp) 



# Bootstrap
Bootstrap is an easy way of giving you access to some CSS that lets you make your websites styled more nicely and mobile-responsive without you do a lot of work. Bootstrap defines a whole bunch of classes for this purpose. It is one of the most popular libraries of HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Example 29: [nobootsrap.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/nobootsrap.html) and [bootsrap.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/bootsrap.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=4486)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/bootstrap.html)

### I've Learned:
* [Getting started](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) with Bootstrap by adding a link line linking to Bootstrap's CSS file, which is located somewhere on the internet.

## Example 30: [column0.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/column0.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=4571)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/column0.html)

### I've Learned:
* Bootstrap's layout system uses a column-based model where the website is divided into 12 individual columns. 
* In this case, I got four sections, these four individual columns that are each taking up three out of the 12 total columns.

## Example 30: [column1.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/column1.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=4671)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/column1.html)

### I've Learned:
* On a large screen, each column will take up three out of the 12 possible columns. There are four sections in a line.
* On a small screen, each one will take up half of the total width of my Bootstrap grid. There are two sections in a line. Bootstrapis is actually written using flexbox.
* When 

## Example 31: [alert.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/alert.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=4930)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/alert.html)

### I've Learned:
* [Create alert messages.](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/)



# Sass
Sass is is it's an extension to CSS that gives us more power and flexibility when it comes to designing CSS stylesheets. It is built on top of CSS.

If I had dozens of different examples of CSS styling in particular colors, I might need to go through all of them and change those individual colors. Sass can help you complete the repetitive work.


## Example 32: [variables](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/variables/variables.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=5042)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/variables/variables.html)

### I've Learned:
* Defining a new variable called color in SCSS file. And its value is going to be red. I replace the value of color attritute with the variable.
* [Installing Sass locally](https://sass-lang.com/install) to see what the resulting CSS looks like, it's a freely and pretty small piece of software. You'll need to install Sass in order to make sass command below.
* Our web browsers understand CSS, but they don't understand Sass file. So we need convert SCSS file into a CSS file by the command

```
$ sass variables.scss variable.css
```
* If I change the variable in the SCSS, the CSS file won't automatically compile. You need to recompile it by the above command. It's annoying every time you make a change to a SCSS file, you're going to need to recompile it again.

Or using the [--watch command](http://sassbreak.com/watch-your-sass/) automatically recompile the CSS file as below.

```
$ sass --watch variables.scss:variable.css
```
* GitHub Pages have built-in support for Sass. GitHub will automatically take care of the process of compiling that Sass file from a .scss file to a .css file.

* The CSS file is the only one that the browser actually understands. Google Chrome doesn't know how to take a Sass file and understand what the variables mean. So what we need to do is referencing to the CSS file.


## Example 33: [nesting.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/nesting/nesting.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=5717)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/nesting/nesting.html)

### I've Learned:
* Using more convenient way to style any paragraphs that are inside of a division in SCSS file. Better than regular CSS.


## Example 34: [inheritance.html](https://jeffrey1183.github.io/coding-notes/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/inheritance/inheritance.html)
* [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQs5KcUj-Do?t=5980)
* [Source code](https://github.com/jeffrey1183/coding-notes/blob/master/My%20Practice/HTML_CSS/inheritance/inheritance.html)

### I've Learned:
* [Inheritance](https://sass-lang.com/guide) in the context of Sass is used to refer to when you have some general styling that you might want to apply to a whole bunch of different things, but each of those different things you want to be styled in a slightly different way.
* Create different background-color messages.
