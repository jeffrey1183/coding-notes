# Introduction

I'm Jeffrey. This is my notes of learning programming with Github. I pick many practical lessons from Udacity and CS50. I list the projects and functionalities I code.

I also like to play music and discover the the connection of programming and music so I create a [music tech blog](https://medium.com/music-tech-alliance). Welcome to communicate with me.

> 這是我學習程式的筆記，歡迎參考。筆記的目的僅僅方便我回頭看之前上過的課。比方說我忘記陣列是什麼，我就會回來找影片連結。
